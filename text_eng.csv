Deception and fraud, plus the wild unprofessionalism of employees. We did refinancing of a car loan and a mortgage-we
promised a rate of 9% instead of 11.5 %, provided that we use the Mir card from the bank's post and make regular payments.
We use the card constantly made payments regularly for two months - as a result, the rate is again 11.5 %, funds are debited from the
card for overdue payments , a damaged credit history. On the tenth attempt, we contacted the mountain ""specialist"",
who can not help in any way and only accepted the application for consideration.
Now we are preparing a lawsuit in court.

The bank is not bad. The quality of service leaves much to be desired, but the bank significantly exceeds the others in terms of rates.
I'm thinking of taking a mortgage from them, I hope everything will work out.

in other departments .After the first conversation, I had confidence that everything would work out ..And so it turned out.

There has never been a debt on the payment of the loan. But the bank starts calling 2 weeks before the payment.
And SMS is sent 5-6 times before the payment deadline. Very annoying. I read the reviews, I'm not the only one with such a situation.
I won't take anything else here in my life.

I have Bank checking and savings account for more than 25 years. However, I finally decided to 
close the account and switch service to another institution. They used to have superb customer service.
But the quality of customer service is horrible nowadays. Also, they let the fraudulent activities happen
without my authorization.

Bank destroyed my credit score by 34 points claiming I filed for bankruptcy which is not true. 
I have somehow have managed to pay off credit cards despite being laid off for 5months in 2020. 
I was starting to pay this one down and they cancelled it and then claimed I’m bankrupt even tho that was
not true and I have never missed a payment.

I’ve only been with Bank for a short time but I have been pleased with the customer service.
I normally use the app or website to get service but I have on occasion called in to get assistance.
They are all very responsive and helpful.

The convenience that Bank offers is unparalleled to other banks. 
The saving interest rate has been competitive during such challenging times.
Although the rates have been dropping, they are still one the top providing the best prices.
